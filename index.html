    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Thomas—a Nairobi-based web developer with a passion for clean code, bold design, and meaningful storytelling. I blend technical precision with cultural creativity, crafting websites that not only look great but speak to the heart of African innovation.
From semantic HTML5 to responsive layouts, I build digital experiences that are accessible, intuitive, and proudly rooted in Kenyan identity. Whether it's a sleek portfolio, a vibrant community site, or a dynamic web app, I bring ideas to life with purpose and personality.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring rugby culture, diving into historical curiosities, or refining my craft one pixel at a time.
Let’s build something unforgettable—grounded in heritage, powered by tech.</p>
